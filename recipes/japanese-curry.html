      <li>2 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 cups (720ml) water or chicken broth</li>
      <li>
        3 tablespoons Japanese curry roux (available in Asian grocery stores or
        online)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Cooked rice for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat.
        Add the sliced onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until the onion is
        softened and translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the meat to the pot and cook until it is browned on all sides.
      </li>

        until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together.
      </li>
      <li>Season the curry with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Serve the Japanese curry hot over cooked rice.</li>
