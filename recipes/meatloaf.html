    <p>Here is a simple recipe for classic meatloaf:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 lb (450g) ground beef (you can also use a mix of ground beef and pork
        or ground turkey)
      </li>
      <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (you can use regular or Panko breadcrumbs)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely chopped bell pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup ketchup (plus extra for topping)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and milk. Let them soak
        for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs have absorbed the milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ground beef, chopped onion, bell pepper (if using), minced
        garlic, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and beaten egg to
        the bowl with the soaked breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using your hands or a spoon, mix all the ingredients together until well
        combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the meatloaf
        tough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the mixture into a loaf shape and place it in a baking dish or on
        a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of ketchup over the top of the meatloaf.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the meatloaf is
        cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 160째F (71째C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, remove the meatloaf from the oven and let it rest for a few
        minutes before slicing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the meatloaf and serve it with your favorite side dishes, such as
        mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a simple salad.
      </li>
    </ol>
